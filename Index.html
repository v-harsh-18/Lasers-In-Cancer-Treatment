            <h2>What is laser?</h2>
            <p>Laser is an ligh emiting device which works on the principle of optical amplication. The word Laser is actually an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. In the modern world the laser used in many useful process ranging from medical treatment to defence infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>What is Cancer?</h2>

            <p>Cancer is abnormal growth of cells in the various body parts which has potential to spread to the other parts of the body. Some of the common types of cancer include Lung Cancer, Skin Cancer, Breast Cancer Prostrate Cancer and Stomach Cancer. Cancer is a life threatning disease.</p>

    <p class="two">Laser Cancer treatment uses high intensity light to treat various types of cancer. Lasers can be used to shrink or destroy tissue or non-healing stems. Lasers are commonly used to treat advanced cancer (cancer of the face or lining of the internal organs) such as basal skin cancer and early stages of certain cancers, such as cervical cancer, penile, vagina, vulvar, and non-small cell lung cancer.

        Lasers can also be used to remove special cancer symptoms, such as bleeding or blockage. For example, lasers can be used to reduce or destroy a tumor that blocks a patient's trachea (windpipe) or esophagus. Lasers can also be used to remove colon polyps or tissues that block the colon or stomach.
        
        Laser treatment  is often mixed with other therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. In addition, lasers can bind nerve endings to reduce pain after surgery and clog lymph nodes to reduce inflammation and limit the proliferation of tumor cells.</p>

        <p class="two">Advantages of Lasers are that they are more accurate than conventional surgical tools (scalpels), so they do less damage to normal tissue. As a result, patients often have less pain, bleeding, swelling and scars. With laser therapy, operations are usually shorter. In fact, laser treatment can often be performed externally. It takes less time for patients to heal after laser surgery, and they are less likely to get infections. Patients should consult with their health care provider about whether laser treatment is appropriate.Laser treatment also has several limitations. Surgeons should have specialized training before performing laser therapy, and strict safety precautions should be taken. Laser treatment is expensive and requires powerful equipment. In addition, the effects of laser treatment may not last long, so doctors may need to repeat the patient's treatment in order to get the full benefit.</p>
